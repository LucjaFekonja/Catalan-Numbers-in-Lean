# Catalan-Numbers-in-Lean

This repository contains a collection of definitions, theorems and proofs implemented in Lean 4. The project is organized under the Project/Basics.lean file, and it includes five small tasks and two attempts at larger tasks.

### Small Tasks
1. Recursive definition of Catalan numbers.
2. Definition of plane trees.
3. Formalization of full binary trees.
4. Construction of full binary trees with $n$ nodes, not counting the leaves.
5. Implementation of ballot_sequence.

### Large Tasks
1. Construction of \textit{rotating isomorphism}.
2. Proof of $(n + 1) \quad | \quad \binom{2n}{n}$.

This project uses Lean 4 and mathlib library.
