# Catalan-Numbers-in-Lean

This repository contains a collection of definitions, theorems and proofs implemented in Lean 4. The project is organized under the [Project/Basic.lean](Project/Basic.lean) file, and it includes five small tasks and three attempts at larger tasks.

### Small Tasks
1. Recursive definition of Catalan numbers.
2. Definition of plane trees.
3. Formalization of full binary trees.
4. Construction of full binary trees with $n$ nodes, not counting the leaves.
5. Implementation of Ballot sequence.

### Large Tasks
1. Bijection between plane trees and a list of plane trees.
2. Construction of *rotating isomorphism*.
3. Proof of $(n + 1) \hspace{0.25em} | \hspace{0.25em} \binom{2n}{n}$.

This project uses Lean 4 and mathlib library.
